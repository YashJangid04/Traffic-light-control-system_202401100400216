# Traffic Simulation with AI Control

This project simulates a simple AI-based traffic control system that dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on vehicle counts.

## Features
- ðŸš¦ Simulates realistic traffic flow
- ðŸ§  AI logic prioritizes busier roads
- ðŸ”„ Alternates lights for smooth vehicle movement

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>


## How it Works
Cars are randomly added or removed to simulate traffic.
The AI controller switches lights based on vehicle count.
Lights switch after two consecutive greens or if traffic is balanced.

## Sample Output
Road1 cars: 2, Road2 cars: 1, Light status: road1_green
Road1 cars: 0, Road2 cars: 4, Light status: road2_green
